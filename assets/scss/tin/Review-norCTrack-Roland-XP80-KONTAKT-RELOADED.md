One of the main features of the Roland XP-80 is its powerful 16-track MRC-Pro sequencer, which allows you to record and edit your musical ideas with ease. You can record up to 60,000 notes in one song, and use the direct-from-disk playback function to load and play songs from a floppy disk without loading time. The sequencer also has new functions like non-stop loop recording, which lets you overdub and punch in/out without stopping the playback. You can also use the Realtime Phrase Sequence (RPS) feature to trigger pre-recorded phrases on the fly, creating dynamic and interactive performances.
 
The Roland XP-80 also has an advanced arpeggiator, which can generate complex and rhythmic patterns based on the notes you play. You can choose from 33 preset arpeggio styles, or create your own using the user arpeggio function. You can also sync the arpeggiator to MIDI clock or external devices, and use the guitar strum mode to simulate guitar strumming effects. The arpeggiator can be applied to any patch or performance, adding more movement and variation to your sound.
 
The Roland XP-80 also has a comprehensive effects section, which offers 42 insert effects that can be applied to individual parts or groups of parts. You can choose from reverb, chorus, delay, ring modulation, distortion, and more, and adjust various parameters to fine-tune your sound. You can also use the Quick Palette feature to assign four effects parameters to four sliders on the front panel, and control them in real time. The XP-80 also has two pairs of independent stereo outputs, which can be used to route different parts or effects to separate channels.
